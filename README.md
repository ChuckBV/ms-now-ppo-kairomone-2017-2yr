# Developing systems for monitoring navel orangeworm in the presence of mating disruption

## Overview
Experiments between 2017 and 2019 compared PPO and kairomone blend, examined 
effect of trap type on PPO effectiveness, and examined sex ratio. Experiments
included:

### 1. Comparison of PPO and kairomone blend

PPO and kairomone blend, alone or along with a pheromone lure, was compared
to a pheromone lure alone. This five treatment x eight replicate RCB 
experiment was performed in four locations: a disrupted and a non-disrupted
almond orchard, and a disrupted and a non-disrupted pistachio orchard.
Experiment was conducted between June 7 and September 12, 2017

### 2. Follow-up comparison

An experiment similar to the previous one was conducted from April 6 to 
June 12, 2018, in order to determine whether trends were different in the
first flight.

### 3. Wing vs. delta vs. bucket traps
